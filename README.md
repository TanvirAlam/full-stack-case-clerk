## 👨‍💻 Use

### ⏱️ 30-Second Walkthrough

1. **Create**: Fill title, subtitle, description, set priority → Enter or click "Add Task"
2. **Prioritize**: Tasks auto-sort by incomplete status → priority (High/Medium/Low) → newest first
3. **Mark Done**: Click ✓ button or use bulk selection for multiple tasks
4. **Undo**: Click "Undo" in the toast notification (5-second window)
5. **Search/Filter**: Use search bar for text matching or filter buttons (All/Active/Done)
6. **Organize**: Drag tasks by the ⋮⋮ handle or use bulk actions for efficiency

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts & Accessibility

- **Ctrl + N**: Focus on new task title input
- **Ctrl + F**: Focus on search input
- **Enter**: Submit forms and create tasks
- **Escape**: Cancel/close dialogs
- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate through interface elements

## 🎨 Design Choices

### State Management & Persistence

**Why LocalStorage?** Provides instant persistence without backend complexity, perfect for a client-side MVP. Data survives browser restarts and is immediately available on app load.

**Architecture Pattern**: Used a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern with React hooks:
- **TodoModel**: Pure business logic with observer pattern for state changes
- **TodoController**: Handles user interactions and coordinates between model and views
- **Views**: Pure presentation components that receive props and emit events
- **Contexts**: Cross-cutting concerns (Toast notifications, Undo functionality)

### Priority, Sorting & UX Philosophy

**Priority System**: High/Medium/Low with visual color coding (Red/Yellow/Green) for immediate recognition. Priority affects sorting order to surface important tasks.

**Smart Sorting Logic**:
1. **Incomplete tasks first** - Focus on what needs to be done
2. **Priority order** - High → Medium → Low within each group
3. **Creation date** - Most recent first for equal priorities

This ensures users see their most urgent, actionable items at the top.

**Undo Philosophy**: 5-second window balances mistake recovery with UI cleanliness. Shows toast with undo action, clearing automatically to avoid clutter.

**Bulk Actions**: Optional feature that enhances power-user productivity without overwhelming casual users. Separate "selection mode" keeps the interface clean when not needed.

### Technical Decisions

**Native HTML5 Drag & Drop**: Chose over external libraries for React 19 compatibility and smaller bundle size. Provides native OS integration and accessibility benefits.

**Styled-Components**: Enables component-scoped styling with TypeScript integration, preventing CSS conflicts in a growing codebase.

**React 19 + TypeScript**: Latest React features with compile-time type safety, improving developer experience and code reliability.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage: 134 Tests Passing

**Edge Case Testing**: Comprehensive coverage including:
- **Empty input validation**: Handles empty titles, whitespace-only input, Unicode whitespace
- **Long content handling**: Tests with 1000+ character titles and 5000+ character descriptions
- **Rapid input scenarios**: Prevents duplicate tasks from quick successive submissions
- **Storage corruption**: Graceful recovery from malformed localStorage data
- **Boundary conditions**: Invalid indices for reordering, non-existent task operations

**Test Categories**:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual model methods, utility functions, validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: Controller interactions, context providers, cross-component communication
- **Edge Case Tests**: Error handling, malformed data, extreme inputs
- **Usability Tests**: Keyboard interactions, focus management, accessibility features

**Easy to Follow Setup**:
```bash
npm test          # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```
